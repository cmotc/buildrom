Buildrom README

I bend a grateful knee to my good friend Erik Andersen, and his buildroot
system from which most of the ideas for this were derived.

Introduction

This is a simple makefile system that designed to build a ROM image for
the OLPC board.  The intention is to build a minimal kernel, an initrd and
the ROM all together with one step rather then the 6 or 8 individual steps
one would take now.

HOWTO

To run the system, type 'make'.  You'll need a connection to the net to
suck down tarballs for the individual packages.  

Currently - the system will build the following packages (in order):

uclibc
busybox
wireless-tools
kernel
mkelfImage

The end result is a .elf file in the deploy/ directory, suitable for adding
as the payload of a LinuxBIOS build.
