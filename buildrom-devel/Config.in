config MAKE_JOBS
	string "Send this option to make to parallelize builds"
	default "-j1"
	help
	  This can speed the build if you have more than one core that you
	  would like to allow make to use.  If you have a single processor, use
	  the default (-j1) otherwise, try processors+1 (-j5 for 4 processors).

	  This option currently only speeds up the kernel and uClibc builds.
	  It was tried for: linuxbios (not passed through to fallback,etc.)
	                    busybox (causes errors)

config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Enable experimental features"
	default n
	help
		Experimental features are not yet ready for prime time and/or 
		completely broken. The features revealed by this setting are likely to be 
		only useful if you are a developer and want to hack on buildrom.

		If you are not sure, say no.
