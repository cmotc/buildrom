	  Allow yourself to do advanced developer things

config EXPERIMENTAL
	bool "Enable experimental features"
	default n
	help
		Experimental features are not yet ready for prime time and/or 
		completely broken. The features revealed by this setting are
		likely to be only useful if you are a developer and want to
		hack on buildrom.

		If you are not sure, say no.

config VERBOSE
	bool "See the build output on stdout"
	default n
	help
	  See the entire build output on stdout. Otherwise, it will
	  be saved off in a series of logs

config STORE_SVN_INFO
	bool "Store svn tree information in deployment directory."
	default y
	help
	  Store the output of 'svn diff', 'svn status' and 'svn info' in the
	  deploy/config/svn/ directory. This means the machine used to build 
	  the coreboot image will need to have internet access during the build.
		
	  If you are not sure, say yes.

config MAKE_JOBS
	int "Number of make jobs to run simultaneously (experimental)"
	default 1
	help
	  This can speed the build if you have more than one core that you
	  would like to allow make to use.  If you have a single processor, use
	  the default (1) otherwise, you can specify the number of cores you
	  have plus 1 (for example, specify 5 if you have 4 cores).

	  This option is currently used for the kernel and uClibc packages.

		Select this option to build a coreboot v3 based ROM.  This

	default y
	help
	  Precompress the payload with LZMA when using coreboot v2. This doesn't
	  work for FILO, OFW, or ETHERBOOT.

	  When using COREBOOT_V3, parse the elf and have lar compress the files.
	  This works with all ELF payloads.
